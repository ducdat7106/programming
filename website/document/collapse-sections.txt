How do I collapse sections of code in Visual Studio Code for Windows?

Fold folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor:
Ctrl + Shift + [ 


Unfold unfolds the collapsed region at the cursor:
Ctrl + Shift + ] 


Fold All folds all regions in the editor:
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + 0 (zero) 


Unfold All unfolds all regions in the editor:
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + J
